## Instructions for the mobile app mentioned in the mail recieved the day before joining
- The app will be used for taking attendance as well as sharing materials like employee id.
- Open the app on Microsoft edge only, with a mobile device with camera.
- In login, add CT/DT (whichever applicable) as well to your reference number.
- Fill up the availibility details and CGPA, proceed to next page. Make sure that once you click on scan on the next page, the browser opens your camera. (check permissions if not opening)
- After that, wait for the QR code that will be given to you during the induction session.
- On scanning the QR code, fill up the form with your current address as this will be the place where TCS will send the work assets to. (The app might be extremely slow as a lot of people will be submitting their details)
## Work from home
- SBWS (Secure Borderless Workspace) is TCS' solution for work from home.
